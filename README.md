# SCHull for Protein
Code for protein experiments in [SCHull](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=OIvg3MqWX2).
## Environment
All experiments were implemented using Python 3.9.20 and Conda 24.11.3, with the required packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
 
## Dataset
All datasets are saved as .mdb file. Download the dataset here and unzip it before running the experiments. The data folders are structured in the following ways:
```bash
.
├── Data                 
│   ├── Reaction-EC
│   │           ├── data.mdb
│   │           ├── lock.mdb
│   │           ├── ...
│   ├── FoldData
│   │         ...
│   │                    
│   ...
```
